Design Ideas
1) All Activities, no Fragments
2) One Activity, all Fragments
3) Some Activities, some Fragments


Choice: (1) (easiest for me to implement quickly)


Login Task Ideas
1) MainActivity has a method, Login, that starts & runs LoginActivity on program start
2) MainActivity starts & runs LoginActivity inside of onCreate, so that logging in is a part of the app's launching sequence
3) 


Choice: (2) (makes the most sense, seems the least convoluted on the surface)


Level 1 Program Flow (based on above choices)

1) App init
2) Main activity init
3) Main activity calls Login activity in onCreate() (uses startActivityForResult)
4) Login activity init
5) Login activity checks entered username and password against a list of accepted login credentials (hard-coded for now)
6) If check fails, indicate error(s)
7) If check succeeds, return successful login
8) Let users register (just add the button for now, add content later)
9) Login activity ends
10) Main activity receives successful login
11) Main activity lets user view quest list
12) If a quest is selected, show quest details
13) If log out is selected, log out & end the application
14)

Level 1

1) v0.1
	A) Activities
		1) Login
		2) Main
		3) Register
		4) 
	B) Manifest
		1) Minimum API: 14
		2) Target API: 19
		3) 
	C) Strings
		1) Login button
		2) Content under construction/incomplete
		3) Log out button
		4) "Hello, questing world!"
		5) Login request
		6) Register button
		7) 
	D) Issues
		1) Cannot resolve symbol 'R' in both activities?
		2) Cannot resolve symbol 'activity_main' in main activity?
		3) Cannot resolve symbol 'main' in main activity?
	E) Notes (as found)
		1) Creating my own login activity seems a lot easier than trying to revise the provided login activity template, just going to do that. (Updated: 4/16)
		2) Issues seem to pop up and resolve themselves randomly, based on how things work out when Android Studio starts up - this may be an issue (or two or five) with my laptop.  Work around this as possible.
